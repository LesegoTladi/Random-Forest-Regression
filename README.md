# Random Forest Regression on the World Population

## Overview

In this project, we use the Random Forest Regression technique to predict the world population over time. The Random Forest algorithm builds an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree makes a prediction, and the final prediction is based on the average of all trees. This ensemble approach helps improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. In this project, we will use world population data from 1960 to 2017, grouped by different income levels, and build a Random Forest model to predict the population for future years.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to explore how Random Forest Regression can be applied to predict the world population based on historical data, grouped by income levels. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Preprocess the world population data and group it by income levels.
2. Use K-Fold cross-validation to split the data and evaluate the model's performance.
3. Train a Random Forest Regressor model on the data and evaluate its accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
4. Predict future population values based on the trained model.

## Imports and Libraries

The following libraries are required for this project:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from numpy import array
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

Data Loading and Preprocessing
Loading Population and Metadata
We load two datasets: one containing world population data and another with metadata that includes the income group of each country.

population_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')
meta_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')
Data Preprocessing and Grouping by Income
We will preprocess the data by grouping it based on the income level and transforming it into a format suitable for training the Random Forest model. This includes creating a 2D NumPy array with the year and corresponding population values.

K-Fold Cross Validation
Implementing K-Fold Cross Validation
We will use the KFold class from scikit-learn to perform K-Fold cross-validation. This method splits the dataset into K subsets and performs the training and testing process K times, ensuring that each data point is used for both training and testing.

def sklearn_kfold_split(data, K):
    # Implement K-Fold split
    pass
Random Forest Model Training and Evaluation
Training the Random Forest Regressor
We will train a Random Forest Regressor model using the data and evaluate its performance for each K-Fold split. The model will be trained using the training set and tested using the testing set, with Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the evaluation metric.


def best_k_model(data, data_indices):
    # Implement model training and evaluation
    pass
Model Prediction
After training the model and evaluating its performance, we can use the best performing model to make predictions. For example, we can predict the population for a given year.

best_model.predict([[1960]])

## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully applied Random Forest Regression to predict the world population using historical data. By using K-Fold cross-validation, we ensured that our model generalizes well. After training the model and evaluating its performance, we were able to make reliable predictions about the population in the years following the dataset's last recorded year.

This project highlights how ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest, can be applied to predict complex data like population trends, helping to make data-driven decisions in global development and policy planning.
