# Random Forest Regression on the World Population

## Overview

In this project, we use the Random Forest Regression technique to predict the world population over time. The Random Forest algorithm builds an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree makes a prediction, and the final prediction is based on the average of all trees. This ensemble approach helps improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. In this project, we will use world population data from 1960 to 2017, grouped by different income levels, and build a Random Forest model to predict the population for future years.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to explore how Random Forest Regression can be applied to predict the world population based on historical data, grouped by income levels. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Preprocess the world population data and group it by income levels.
2. Use K-Fold cross-validation to split the data and evaluate the model's performance.
3. Train a Random Forest Regressor model on the data and evaluate its accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
4. Predict future population values based on the trained model.

## Imports and Libraries

The following libraries are required for this project:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from numpy import array
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the datasets
population_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')
meta_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')

# Example of preprocessing code (modify based on your actual data processing)
# This step will vary depending on how your datasets are structured
# Process population data and metadata as required

def sklearn_kfold_split(data, K):
    kf = KFold(n_splits=K, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    return kf.split(data)

def best_k_model(data, data_indices):
    X_train, X_test = data[data_indices[0]], data[data_indices[1]]
    y_train, y_test = target[data_indices[0]], target[data_indices[1]]
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    return model, mse

best_model = best_k_model(population_df, sklearn_kfold_split(population_df, 5))
prediction = best_model[0].predict([[1960]])
```
## Conclusion
In this project, I successfully applied Random Forest Regression to predict the world population using historical data. By using K-Fold cross-validation, I ensured that my model generalizes well. After training the model and evaluating its performance, I was able to make reliable predictions about the population in the years following the dataset's last recorded year.

This project highlights how ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest, can be applied to predict complex data like population trends, helping me make data-driven decisions in global development and policy planning.
